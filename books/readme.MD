# Books
When I was first learning Python/coding, I found it endlessly enjoyable to parse old ebooks. I have included a few here for you to do the same.

I have tidied these up a bit. 

## Project Gutenberg
These books are from Project Gutenberg https://www.gutenberg.org/. I made a small donation to Gutenberg when I was creating this repo, if you have fun playing with these eBook, you should too!

As requested by the license in these books, I am putting this blurb here:
